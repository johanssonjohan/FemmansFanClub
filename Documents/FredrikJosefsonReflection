The first week
What do I want to learn or understand better?
* I had never worked with neither scrum or Github so first of all i want to learn how to work with SCRUM and how SCRUM will help us in our project. I also want to learn more about Github and how it works.  


How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
* since we just started the course I´ve just started to developed knowledge myself and all members of the group have quite the same amount of knowledge right now, therefore its hard for me to learn the groups something new.  .
* But I will try to help the group to learn something new by contribute with positive energy at our meetings.


What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
* In order to contribute to the application of scrum i need to understand i know what scrum is and how to use it myself, therefore my biggest part of contribution this week have been to understand scrum myself.
* I have also contributed by explained the things we learned about scrum att the first lecture for some members of the group that did not attend to the lecture. 

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in 
relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and  skills learnt as well as how this was achieved),
what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. 
The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. 
It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you 
evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
* My learning objective is to improve my knowledge about scrum and how to work with it. I want to have knowledge enough to be able to start working with it next week.
