what do I want to learn or understand better?
  * I want to understand how to use GitHub more efficiently and also increase my understanding of SCRUM. 

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  * We are right now in the start-up phase and because we all have the same programming background we all have the same basic level of understanding. We have been able to understand SCRUM better through discussions.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
  * My contribution has been to try and understand how SCRUM works and also how to use GitHub seing as it is relatively new to me. I have done this by attending lectures aswell as read litterature.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
That means that for the personal learning objective you 
will each week write down what you have achieved in relation 
to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and skills 
learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like 
to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. 
The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. 
It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you 
evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
  * We have not yet started the project so it is hard to set a good objective. My learning objective for the following week is to understand SCRUM well enough to be able to start on the project and to decide key roles of the project.
