Week 1


What do I want to learn or understand better?
* Since the project-sprints hasn't officially started yet I would first and foremost like to learn more about working agile in the SCRUM-way.
* I am also inexperienced when it comes to working with github so I want to improve my knowledge in this area.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
* So far the team seems to be on an even playing field, with everyone having pretty much the same background so there isn't much to learn from eachother yet.
* Through discussions with the team we have increased our collective knowledge in SCRUM.

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
* I have contributed by helping with setting up our weekly preliminairy schedule and reading up on the ways of working in SCRUM in order to spread my knowledge to the team members.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in relation to last week's ambition 
(technologies, concepts and skills learnt as well as how this was achieved), what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. 
The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change 
and you evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
* My learning objective of this week has, as mentioned above, to increase my knowledge in agile programming and in the ways of SCRUM. I have done this both through scrum-discussions with the group but also through reading up on the ways of working in scrum and attending the lectures.
* I am also planning on increasing my knowledge working in github, and understanding the platform better in order to maximize our workflow. 
* We haven't started with the official project yet, but next week my ambition is to understand the main project objectives and make necessary preparations for our first official sprint.
