 Week 1
What do I want to learn or understand better?
- I want to understand the SCRUM framework better and to learn more how this may help our development project. Furhter, I want to learn more about agile development.
- To be able to fully contribute to the development of the project I need to learn more about GITHUB and the different tools that are needed.

How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- Right now, we have only developed very basic knowledge about the area and not any specific knowledge wherefore it is hard to distinguish how I can help other.
- However, I have will have an open mindset and try to help my team members the best way I can

What is my contribution towards the team’s application of scrum?
- This week my contribution will mainly consist of trying to understand scrum my self, since this is needed to contribute the application of scrum.
- Also, I have contributed by trying to encourage our team spirit and trying to set a good direction for the project early.

What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? 
That means that for the personal learning objective you will each week write down what you have achieved in 
relation to last week's ambition (technologies, concepts and  skills learnt as well as how this was achieved),
what you would like to achieve for the next week and how to make the change happen. 
The first week of the course you describe the current situation by motivating a learning objective. 
It is perfectly fine to change objective/s each week as long as you can motivate the change and you 
evaluate the outcome of the previous week (e.g. describing the current situation).
- My learning objective is to 
    - Gain a better understanding of the scrum framewoek
    - Improve my knowledge about agile development
    - Try to learn my working group better
    - Continously work with the development of the product
    
Since it is the first week of the project it is hard to set good and relevant objectives but I will 
update these continously when I have gotten a better understanding about what and how
to measure my performance.
